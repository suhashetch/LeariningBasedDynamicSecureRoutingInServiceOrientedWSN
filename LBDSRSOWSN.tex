% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -

% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{W}{ireless} Sensor Networks is a network of sensors that are autonomous. These sensors are spatially distributed for capturing data. They have restricted computational and communication power. They have little memory and limited battery power. The data collected by the individual sensors is then passed on to the base station or the sink. The sink will process the accumulated data for the specific application. Sensors networks have been widely used in military applications, monitoring the environment, healthcare applications and surveillance.\\ \\
\indent In WSN, we have a family of sensors called the \textit{service oriented WSNs}. These WSNs are different from the usual ones, in that they have a specific task. The sensors may not be communicating all the time. They will trigger communication only when they come across a state change. For example, consider a WSN monitoring the enemy infiltration. State change in this situation can be identification of an enemy tank in the surveillance area. State changes in such situations do not occur every now and then. But when they do, it must be reported immediately. A large delay in data delivery or data loss is unacceptable in such situations. \\ \\
\indent In these kind of real time systems, there will be little or room for delay. In such applications congestion detection becomes critical. Effecient load balancing in order to overcome congestion becomes highly important. A packet should  never enter the congested part of the network. Further considering the criticality of the application, it becomes even more important that the data moves along a secure path only. But it is even more important to have a dynamic and adaptive load balancing and security schemes. \\ \\
\indent Dynamic decision making capability at every node will enhance load balancing and security. Handling unforeseen changes in the network will prove beneficial in real time WSNs. Static routing may fail in such cases and lead to packet loss. Whereas handling such situations intelligently at every hop will not only reduce congestion but also prevent packet loss. \\ \\
\indent Therefore it is necessary to have a robust routing technique that is both dynamic and adpative to every change in the network along the path of the packet. Congestion and security analysis can be made dynamic by impelementing them at every hop. This means, we have to check for congestion and security of the next node before sending the packet to that node. When both congestion detection and security monitoring is performed at every node, there is a computation and energy overhead in the network. This will lead to increased latency in the network and will drain the sensor battery quickly. \\ \\
\indent \textit{Motivation}: The resources of a sensor node such as computational power and battery life is limited. But the data transmitted by each of the nodes is of high importance. Most of the existing protocols compromise on congestion detection or security yielding to the limited resources of a sensor. On the other hand, most protocols remain static and do not adapt to the dynamics of the network. Both these classes of protocols will not facilitate the efficient functioning of a service oriented WSN. \\ \\
\indent \textit{Contribution}: In the proposed scheme, every sensor node monitors the load at each of its neighbours. It even analyses the strength of each of its neighbours to determine malicious data. It transmits data only to those nodes that are least congested and highly secure. Since the analysis of the two parameters at every hop introduces an overhead in the network we have a feedback system that enables the network to learn from every decision  taken. Initiatially for a certain part of the communication, the source is made to learn about all the paths that are least congested and most secure through the feedback system. Once the source has sufficient data, it makes an analysis of the collected feedback and predicts the most trustworthy path. A feedback system will inform the node about the rightness of each prediction. \\ \\ 
\indent Our technique basically divides the entire communication into two parts. In the first part, the congestion detection and security analysis is performed and feedback is obtained to justify the decisions taken. In the second part instead of performing the congestion detection and security analysis once again, we use the feedback data already obtained to predict a path for each packet. This will greatly reduce the time and energy that will be spent on analysing the two parameters that happens in the initial part of the communication. \\ \\
\indent The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of all the Related Works. The background of the paper is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 defines the main problem and the network model is presented in Section 5. The mathematical model is explained in Section 6 and its implementation is shown in Section 7. The algorithm is discussed in Section 8 and the simulation and performance evaluation is contained in Section 9. The conclusions are presented in Section 10.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the

\section{Mathematical Model}

\subsection{Congestion Detection}
In this section, we will discuss a congestion detection model for Wireless Sensor Networks.\\
Consider a node $N$ with packet arrival rate $A_r$ and packet service rate $S_r$
The traffic at node $N$ is given by,
\begin{equation}
T=\frac{A_r}{S_r}
\end{equation}

There will be stability at the node only when the following condition is met,
\begin{equation}
T<1
\end{equation}

Let the $B_s$ be the size of the buffer at node $N$ and $n$ be the total number of neighbors of the node $N$. The probobility that the node is idle at a given instance of time is,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P_{idle} & = \frac{1}{1+(\frac{A_r}{S_r})+{(\frac{A_r}{S_r})}^{2}+{(\frac{A_r}{S_r})}^{3}....{(\frac{A_r}{S_r})}^{\infty}}\\
		 & = \frac{S_r-A_r}{S_r}\\
P_{idle} & = 1-(\frac{A_r}{S_r})
\end{split}
\end{equation}   
From (1) we can say that,
\begin{equation}
P_{idle}=1-T 
\end{equation}
When the number of packets in the buffer is $B_s - N$ we say that the node is tending towards congestion. The probability that the node is tending towards congestion ig given by,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P(B_s - bufferedPackets = N) &=P_{idle}{\Big(\frac{A_r}{S_r}\Big)}^{N}\\
                                               &=\frac{S_r-A_r}{S_r}\times \frac{{A_r}^{N}}{{S_r}^{N}}\\
P(B_s - bufferedPackets = N) &=\frac{(S_r-A_r){A_r}^{N}}{{S_r}^{N+1}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Probability that there will be a buffer overflow is given by,
\begin{equation}
P_{overflow}=\sum\limits_{i=B_s}^{\infty}\Big(1-\frac{A_r}{S_r}\Big){\Big(\frac{A_r}{S_r}\Big)}^{i}={\Big(\frac{A_r}{S_r}\Big)}^{B_s}
\end{equation}
In order to prevent packet loss to a certain required value $R_v$the following condition should be met
\begin{equation}
{\Big(\frac{A_r}{S_r}\Big)}^{B_s}\le R_v
\end{equation}
To obtain the buffer size $B_s$ for the required packet loss value $R_v$,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\log{\Big(\frac{A_r}{S_r}\Big)}^{B_s}&\le \log(R_v)\\
B_s \log\Big(\frac{A_s}{S_r}\Big)&\le \log(R_v)\\
B_s &>\frac{\log(R)}{\log\Big(\frac{A_r}{S_r}\Big)}\\
B_s &>\log_\frac{A_r}{S_r}R
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Subsituting (1) in (8),
\begin{equation}
B_s >\log_TR
\end{equation}

\subsection{Node Strength}
Node Strength is the measure of the ability of a node to detect malicious data.\\
Let $K_t$ be the number of true keymatches at a node $N$, then the Node Strength $NS$ of $N$ is,
\begin{equation}
NS\propto \sum K_t
\end{equation}
Further, Node Strength is dependent on the number of false keymatches $K_f$ as,
\begin{equation}
NS\propto \frac{1}{\sum K_f}
\end{equation}
Combining the above two equations Node Strength is given by,
\begin{equation}
NS=k.\frac{K_t}{K_f}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\\
Node Strength of a node $N$ is a relative parameter, which means that it has meaning only when compared with Node Strengths of other nodes in the same network. As an absolute value, Node Strength has no meaning.\\
Since all the nodes have the same size of keyspace, we can ignore the constant of proportionality $k$,
\begin{equation}
NS=\frac{\sum K_t}{\sum K_f}    
\end{equation}
We know that, probability of a true keymatch is proportional to the total number of true keymatches,
\begin{equation}
P_{K_t}\propto \sum K_t
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P_{K_t}=\frac{\sum K_t}{\sum totalKeymatches}
\end{equation}
The propbability of a false keymatch is directly proportional to the total number of false keymatches,
\begin{equation}
P_{K_f} \propto \sum K_f
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P_{K_t}=\frac{\sum K_f}{\sum totalKeymatches}
\end{equation}
Therefore we can say that,
\begin{equation}
\frac{P_{K_t}}{P_{K_f}}=\frac{\sum K_t}{\sum K_f}=NS
\end{equation}
Further, we can say that,
\begin{equation}
P_{K_f} = 1-P_{K_t}
\end{equation}
Substituting for $P_{K_f}$,
\begin{equation}
NS=\frac{P_{K_t}}{1-P_{K_t}}
\end{equation}


\section{Secure Dynamic Load Balancing Sceheme}
\subsection{Dynamic Load Balancing}
The congestion detection algorithm basically classifies a node as 'Tending Towards Congestion [TTC]' or 'Available'. A node will be classified as TTC if its buffer is so much filled that it can atmost accomodate only one packet sent by each of its neighbour. A node $n$ with buffer size $B_s$ and a total number of neighboring nodes $N$ will tend towards congestion when the number of packets in its buffer is equal to $B_s - N$. Once the number of packets in the buffer is lesser than $B_s - N$, it will be classified as available.\\ \\
\indent Every node will maintain a \textit{Neighbour Information Table [NIT]}. This table will contain information whether each of its neighbours is tending towards congestion or available. Once a node realizes that it is tending towards congestion, it will imediately send a message to all its neighbours updating them about its status. A node which sends such a message must also send an \textit{available} message to all its neighbours as soon as it comes out of the TTC situation.\\ \\
\indent Once a node receives status information about its neighbours, it will update its \textit{Neighbour Information Table}. When a packet has to be routed, the node will first obtain the multiple paths. Then, the first node on each of these paths is taken and checked for congestion. If the NIT says that the node is available, then the node is retained, else the node gets rejected. 

\subsection{Node Strength}
In this phase, the nodes that clear the congestion detection test will be then tested for node strength. The node strength of a node will tell us the capability of that node to detect malicious data.\\ \\
\indent To determine the node strength of a particular  node, we need to obtain the total number of true keymatches and the total number of false keymatches of that node. Once this data is obtained, the node strength of that node is derived by dividing the total number of true keymatches by the total number of false keymatches. Comparing the node strengths of multiple nodes, we can get a clear picture of the most secure node. The node with the highest node strength will be the most secure node. This means that the node has a good track record of determining legitimate and malicious data.

\subsection{Packet Routing}
Once we select the node with the higest node strength, we can be sure that the node is least congested as well. This is because, the node has been shortlisted for node strength analysis only after analysing its congestion status.\\ \\
\indent Now, the packet will be routed to that node. At the next node the entire secure dynamic route selection procedure is executed to determine the next hop for the packet. By doing so we can be sure that we will be adapting to any of the unforeseen changes in the network that may not be known to the source prior to the routing.

\section{Learning}
\subsection{Route Statistics Collection}
This phase is a training data collection collection phase. It will run parallely from the begining of the data transmission uptil the prediction phase begins. The source node maintains a \textit{Learning Table} that will facilitate the collection of route information. The \textit{Learning Table} consists of a column for the route taken by a packet, one column for the number of packets that went along that route, one column for the sum total of the delay of every packet that went along that route. This is needed to obtain the average delay in future. \\ \\
\indent As soon as  the source node receives an acknowledgement from the destination, it will look for the route information sent by the destination and the timestamp. If the route has not been entered in the \textit{Learning Table} previously, it means that it is a new route taken by a packet. In such a case, a new entery is made to the \textit{Learning Table}. If the route already already exists, the packet count for that entry will be increamented and the sum total of the delay will be updated by determing the packet delay using the timestamp sent by the destination and adding it to the existing value in the corresponding entry of the \textit{Learning Table}. 

\subsection{Weight Assignment}
In this phase, each route will be analysed to determine the best route for a prediction. Once the treshold number of packets have been transmitted, i.e once we have collected sufficient training data, we must analyse each of the routes and assign weights to them. The weight of a route is the trust factor of that route.\\ \\
\indent A route is trust worthy if it has lesser delay and a good number of packets have been sent along that route. A route with least delay alone or a route along which the maximum packets have been sent alone cannot be declared as the most trusted route. Trust factor is a more comprehensive value which evaluates both the delay of the route and the number of packets sent along the route.\\ \\
\indent The weight of a route is determined by dividing the quotient obtained by dividing the average delay along that route by the sum total of the average delay along all the route, by the quotient obtained by diving the number of packets sent along the route by the total number of packets sent by the source.\\ \\  

\subsection{Prediction and Feedback}
The weights of each route will give us an idea about the trust factor of each route. The route with least weight will mean that it has lesser delay and a good number of packets have been sent along that route compared to other routes. We then choose this path to route the next packet. \\ \\
\indent During the prediction phase, the path for a packet will be fixed. This means that at every node the congestion detection scheme and the security scheme need not be executed. This is because we have decided to route the packet along this path only after studying the routes performance until the threshold number of packets were transmitted. Since each node along this route has passed the congestion detection test and the node strength analysis, the performance of the route will reflect in the weight of that route which was considered for deciding to transmit the packet along this route. \\ \\
\indent In order to bypass the congestion detection and node strength schemes, a flag is set in the packet. Further the entire route will be mentioned in the packet before routing it. At every hop, when an intermediate node gets this packet, it checks for the bypass flag. If it is set, the node will blindly route it to the next hop mentioned in the packet. Once the packet reaches the destination, the destination will send the route details and the timestamp of packet arrival back to the source. \\ \\
\indent The source will then compute the delay obtained along the route and repeat the weight assignment procedure and then make the next prediction. This scheme is also dynamic because, if a wrong prediction is made, that means, if the delay along the route increased due to some reason unknown to the source, the feedback from the destination will enlighten the source about the situation. The weight will be accordingly adjusted which will then reduce the trust factor of such routes.
